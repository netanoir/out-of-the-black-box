## About
Out of the Black Box (OBB) is a summer workshop series for children aged 7-11 to uncover the magical logic of computation through arts and crafts. OBB is inspired by the 90s children television series [Out of the Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Box_(TV_series)).

## Learning objectives
Facilitators will teach

## Learning outcomes
Students will learn

## Code of conduct
In the classroom, we agree to conduct ourselves in support of the following values:

Value | Description
--- | ---
**Equality** | Teachers and students are on the same level. Teachers will assume their position in the classroom as facilitators, rather than lecturers or disciplinaries. A good teacher is also a good student. A good student is also a good teacher. Both students and teachers can learn from each other. Every person in the classroom has the opportunity to contribute to discussions and activities. 
**Generosity** | TK TK
**Care** | TK TK


## Activities 
### Bug Drawbots
**Dates**: July 30-31

**Description**: Teachers and students will help each other make bug drawbots and talk about the secret life of bugs like ants.

**Materials**:
- 3 assorted color markers (per person)
- 1 rubber band (per person)
- 1 lump of plasticine, blue tak or silly puddy (per person)

**Discussion**: TK TK

### Squishy Circuits
**Dates**: August 6-7

**Description**: Teachers and students will play with conductive play dough to learn the basics of circuits. 

**Materials**:
- 1 [Squishy Circuits Standard Kit](https://squishycircuits.com/collections/kits/products/standard-kit) (per 4-5 persons)

**Discussion**: Start the discussion by giving a verbal description of the activity and defining the vocabulary terms. It can be helpful to pass out materials as they are defined to associate the word to the object. Always ask if a student knows what a word means before you define it. If they know the meaning, ask them to explain it to the class.

### Vocabulary:
Word | Definition
--- | ---
circuit | the path that electical currents flow; a completed circuit takes the shape of a circle
voltage | the push that makes electric charges move
short circuit | an electrical current where a path of very low resistance has been created
conductor | a material or object that allows electrical current to flow through it
insulator | a material or object that doesn't allow electrical current to flow through it
led | stands for "light emitting diode," a semiconductor device that emits visible light when an electric current passes through it
terminal | a conductive surface that provides an electrical connection point

### Conductive Self Portraits
**Dates**: August 13-14

**Description**: Using conductive paint, teachers and students will each make a portrait of themselves. Once everyone is done with their portrait, we will connect each portrait together in a chainlink circuit powered by an Arduino to make up our family/classroom portrait.

**Materials**: 
- 25~50 sheets of colored paper
- Graphite powder
- Acrylic paint
- 1~3 paint brushes (per 2 persons)
- 1 paint tray (per 3~5 persons)

**Discussion**: Talk about the importance of family. What we mean when we say family, is a collective. A group of people who share and maintain space together. Here in this classroom, we set up the class, participated in activities together, looked after each other and this space, and contributed to the group. 

  Guiding questions:
- What does the word family mean to you? 
- Who have you chosen to be a part of your family? 
-How does your family work together?
